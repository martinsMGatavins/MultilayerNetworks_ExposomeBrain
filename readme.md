# Multilayer network associations between the exposome and childhood brain development

Code available in the repository: structural and functional MRI preprocessing, network construction (including residualization of brain measures), and sum score analysis

Code assumes that structural images have been processed using [minimally containerized BIDS scripts](https://github.com/mackeylab/bids_ppc_scripts) for structural images. For functional images, preprocessing scripts are available in this repository [here](~/preproc/)
