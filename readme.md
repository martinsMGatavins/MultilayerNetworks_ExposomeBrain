# Multilayer network associations between the exposome and childhood brain development

Code available in the repository: structural and functional MRI preprocessing, network construction (including residualization of brain measures), and sum score analysis

## Preprocessing
Code assumes that structural images have been processed using Freesurfers ~recon_all~ for structural images. For functional images, preprocessing scripts are available in this repository [here](/preproc/).
